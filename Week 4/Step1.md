# Background

Your client, PetsCare, is a local clinic that takes care of pets, including pet wellness and vaccination, medical services, surgery including spay and neuter, dental cleaning and treatment, grooming, etc. PetsCare has served the community for more than 20 years, and has been successful in the business.

Recently, the current owner, Claire, who is the daughter of the founder of PetsCare, realized that the old file system solution is very inefficient.
